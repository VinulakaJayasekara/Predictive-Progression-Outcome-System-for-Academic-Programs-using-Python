The coursework specification for a software development module, focusing on creating a Python program to predict academic progression outcomes based on credit data. The coursework covers learning outcomes related to algorithmic analysis, programming implementation, data structures, and using development environments.

The main requirements include creating a program to predict progression outcomes for individual students, validating input data, handling multiple student entries, and generating a histogram of outcomes. Additionally, there are extensions to store data in lists, text files, and dictionaries.

Students are also required to use user-defined functions, provide descriptive variable/function names, and demonstrate their solution in a coursework demo session. Grading criteria are detailed, emphasizing completion of various parts of the coursework and effective demonstration of understanding during the demo session.
